 # ClientSettings.
#
# These are available in code as "ClientSettings.setting_name".
# Settings repeated under the client key ("unifrutti", "stargrow") will override the value in the "defaults" key.
#
# Any new option *must* be set in defaults.
# Only set an option for the client if it differs from the default.
#
# NB *** Do not place comments in lines on their own ***
#        - they will become part of the value of the line above.
#        - ONLY place comments at the end of the line (with a space before the #).
